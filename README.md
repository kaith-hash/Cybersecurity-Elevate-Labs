# Cybersecurity-Elevate-Labs
Objective: Learn to discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand network exposure. 
Tools: Nmap
Key Concepts: Port scanning, TCP SYN scan, IP ranges, network reconnaissance, open ports, network security basics

So, my local Area Network consists of a 192.168.1.1/24 IP subnet.
Firstly, I installed Nmap on my Windows 11 machine. You can either use Windows or Linux OS for scanning the port using Nmap, but using Linux is more reliable in the cybersecurity field.
Using- nmap -sS 192.168.1.1/24
