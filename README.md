## Task 1: Discovering Open Ports in the Local Network

This task focuses on performing basic **network reconnaissance** to discover **open ports** on devices within the local network. [cite_start]This is a fundamental step in understanding the network's exposure and potential security risks[cite: 1].

### **Objective**

* [cite_start]Use **Nmap** to perform a port scan on devices in the local network[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]Understand key concepts like TCP SYN scanning, IP ranges, and open port significance[cite: 1].

### **Tools Used**

* [cite_start]**Nmap** (Network Mapper) [cite: 1]
* [cite_start]**Operating System:** Windows 11 (or Linux for better reliability in cybersecurity) [cite: 1]
* [cite_start]**Target Network:** 192.168.1.1/24 IP subnet [cite: 1]

### **Key Concepts**

| Concept | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Port Scanning** | [cite_start]The process of sending requests to a range of ports on a target device to determine which ports are open and active[cite: 1]. |
| **IP Ranges** | [cite_start]A set of IP addresses, often denoted using **CIDR notation** (e.g., `192.168.1.1/24`), which specifies all devices within a particular subnet[cite: 1]. |
| **Open Ports** | [cite_start]Ports on a host that are accepting connections, often indicating a running service (e.g., web server, SSH, FTP)[cite: 1]. |
| **Network Exposure** | [cite_start]The measure of what services or entry points an attacker can see and potentially interact with on a network[cite: 1]. |
| **Ethics/Legal** | [cite_start]Only scan hosts/networks you own or have explicit permission to test[cite: 1]. |

***

## **Step-by-Step Implementation**

### **1. Nmap Installation**

1.  [cite_start]**Install Nmap** on the chosen machine (Windows or Linux)[cite: 1].
    * [cite_start]*(Note: While Windows 11 was used, Linux is considered more reliable for cybersecurity tasks)[cite: 1].*

### **2. Performing the TCP SYN Scan**

The core of this task involves executing a **TCP SYN Scan (`-sS`)** against the entire local subnet.

| Step | Command/Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2.1** | [cite_start]Open the terminal or command prompt (with Administrator/root privileges)[cite: 1]. | [cite_start]The scan requires **raw packet privileges** to function correctly[cite: 1]. |
| **2.2** | [cite_start]Execute the scan command: `nmap -sS 192.168.1.1/24`[cite: 1]. | [cite_start]This initiates a **stealth scan** across all 254 possible host IPs in the `192.168.1.1/24` subnet[cite: 1]. |

### **3. Understanding the TCP SYN Scan (`-sS`)**

[cite_start]The TCP SYN scan is a **"half-open"** or **stealth scan** because it avoids completing the standard TCP 3-way handshake[cite: 1].

#### **How it Works (Packet Inspection)**

[cite_start]The scan sends a **TCP SYN packet** (Synchronization) to the target ports and interprets the reply[cite: 1]:

* **Port Open:** The target sends a **SYN/ACK** (Synchronization-Acknowledgement). [cite_start]The scanner then typically sends an **RST** (Reset) to immediately close the connection, thus avoiding a full handshake[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Port Closed:** The target sends an **RST** (Reset) packet[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Port Filtered:** There is **No reply** or an **ICMP unreachable** message is received, often indicating a firewall or a packet-dropping rule is in place[cite: 1].

#### **Stealth and Trade-offs**

* [cite_start]**Why Stealth?** By avoiding the final `ACK` packet, it leaves fewer connection traces than a full TCP connect scan (`-sT`), making it harder to log by host-based tools[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Trade-off:** While generally faster and quieter than a connect scan, it is still detectable by modern Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and network monitoring tools[cite: 1].

### **4. Common Scan Additions**

While the basic scan is useful, Nmap offers parameters to enrich the findings:

* [cite_start]`-p`: Specify ports to scan (e.g., `-p1-65535` for all ports)[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]`-sV`: Attempt to detect the **service and version** running on open ports[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]`-O`: Attempt to perform **OS detection** to identify the target's operating system[cite: 1].

## **Step-by-Step Implementation**

### **1. OpenVAS (GVM) Installation and Setup**

The first step is to install and set up the Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) framework, which includes OpenVAS.

| Step | Command/Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1.1** | `sudo apt install openvas` | [cite_start]Install the OpenVAS package and its dependencies on Kali Linux[cite: 6]. |
| **1.2** | `sudo gvm-setup` | [cite_start]Run the setup script to configure the Greenbone Vulnerability Manager (GVM)[cite: 7]. This may take a significant amount of time as it downloads and processes all necessary vulnerability data (NVTs). |
| **1.3** | `sudo gvm-check-setup` | [cite_start]Verify that the GVM/OpenVAS installation and setup were successful[cite: 8]. |

---

### **2. Accessing the Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA)**

Once the setup is complete, the OpenVAS web interface, known as the Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA), will be ready.

1.  [cite_start]**Navigate** to the following address in your web browser: `https://127.0.0.1` (or the local IP of your Kali machine)[cite: 10].
2.  [cite_start]**Log in** using the default credentials[cite: 11]:
    * [cite_start]**Username:** `admin` [cite: 12]
    * [cite_start]**Password:** `admin` [cite: 13]

### **3. Starting the Vulnerability Scan**

[cite_start]The initial scan is recommended against the localhost (`127.0.0.1`) to ensure the installation is working correctly[cite: 16].

1.  [cite_start]**Navigate** to the scanning interface: **Scans** > **Tasks**[cite: 15].
2.  [cite_start]**Start the configuration wizard** by clicking on the purple magic wand icon (Quick start)[cite: 15].
3.  [cite_start]**Set the scan target** to `127.0.0.1` (localhost) to test your installation[cite: 16, 18].
    * [cite_start]*Note: Later scans can target other IPs, such as the one mentioned in the task, `192.168.1.98`[cite: 23].*
4.  [cite_start]**Click "Start Scan"** to begin the process[cite: 16, 17].
5.  **Wait** for the scan to finish. [cite_start]The scan progress can be monitored, and upon completion, the task status will show as "Done"[cite: 19].

---

### **4. Reviewing the Vulnerability Report**

After the scan is complete, the results can be analyzed in the reports section.

1.  [cite_start]**Navigate** to: **Scans** > **Reports**[cite: 20].
2.  [cite_start]**Select** the newly created report for the scan (e.g., "Immediate scan of IP 127.0.0.1")[cite: 20].

#### **Initial Localhost Scan Findings**

[cite_start]A successful initial scan against the localhost (`127.0.0.1`) should typically show vulnerabilities related to OpenVAS/GVM itself, which is normal for a default installation[cite: 21, 22].

* **Example Findings:**
    * [cite_start]**OpenVAS / Greenbone Vulnerability Manager Default Credentials** (Severity: High, 10.0) [cite: 20]
    * [cite_start]**SSL/TLS: Certificate Expired** (Severity: Medium, 5.0) [cite: 20]

#### **Host Scan Summary (Example: 192.168.1.98)**

[cite_start]The full report for a specific host (e.g., `192.168.1.98`) provides a summary of findings[cite: 23, 25]:

| **Category** | **Count** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **High** | 9 |
| **Medium** | 28 |
| **Low** | 2 |
| **Log** | 0 |
| **False Positive** | 0 |

[cite_start]The report also includes an **open port summary** and **host authentication** details[cite: 26].

---

### **5. Analyzing and Documenting a Critical Vulnerability**

[cite_start]The final step is to analyze a specific vulnerability reported by OpenVAS and document a mitigation strategy[cite: 27, 29].

#### **Vulnerability Example: OS End of Life Detection**

| Detail | Information from Report |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Vulnerability Name** | [cite_start]**OS End of Life Detection** [cite: 30] |
| **Severity** | [cite_start]**High** (CVSS: 10.0) [cite: 30] |
| **Affected System** | [cite_start]Ubuntu Linux, Version 8.04 [cite: 32, 33] |
| **End of Life (EOL) Date** | [cite_start]2013-05-09 [cite: 35, 43] |
| **Summary** | [cite_start]The OS has reached EOL, meaning it no longer receives security updates, patches, or vendor support[cite: 38, 39]. [cite_start]Using EOL software exposes the system to known and unknown vulnerabilities[cite: 40]. |
| **Detection Method** | [cite_start]OS End of Life Detection (OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.25623.1.0.103674) [cite: 52, 53] |

#### [cite_start]**Solution / Mitigation** [cite: 45, 50]

The primary solution for an End-of-Life operating system is to upgrade to a supported version.

* [cite_start]**Recommended Action:** Upgrade the operating system to a supported version (e.g., Ubuntu 24.04 LTS or the latest supported LTS)[cite: 46].
* **Best Practices:**
    * [cite_start]Backup critical data before starting the upgrade process[cite: 47].
    * [cite_start]Test critical applications on the new OS version for compatibility[cite: 48].
    * [cite_start]Apply the latest patches and security updates immediately after the OS upgrade[cite: 49].
